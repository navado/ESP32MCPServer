# Contributing to ESP32 MCP Server

We welcome contributions and encourage the use of AI assistants to help with development. This guide outlines how to effectively contribute while leveraging AI tools.

## Using AI for Development

### Recommended AI Tools
- GitHub Copilot for code completion and suggestions
- ChatGPT/Claude for code review, documentation, and problem-solving
- GPT-4 for complex architectural decisions and refactoring suggestions

### Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

#### 1. Code Generation
- Use AI to generate initial code implementations
- Always review and test AI-generated code
- Include test cases in your AI prompts
- Ask AI to explain complex parts of generated code

Example prompt:
```
Create a new feature for [component] that does [functionality].
Include:
- Header and implementation files
- Unit tests
- Documentation
- Integration example
```

#### 2. Documentation
- Use AI to generate and maintain documentation
- Ask AI to explain existing code and create documentation
- Have AI review and improve existing documentation
- Generate examples and usage scenarios

Example prompt:
```
Review this code and generate:
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Common pitfalls
- Performance considerations
```

#### 3. Code Review
- Ask AI to review your changes before submitting
- Use AI to suggest improvements and optimizations
- Have AI check for common issues and best practices
- Request security review from AI

Example prompt:
```
Review this code change for:
- Potential bugs
- Performance issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Style guide compliance
```

#### 4. Testing
- Generate test cases using AI
- Ask AI to identify edge cases
- Use AI to create mock objects and test fixtures
- Have AI suggest testing strategies

Example prompt:
```
Generate unit tests for this class covering:
- Normal operation
- Edge cases
- Error conditions
- Performance benchmarks
```

### AI Usage Guidelines

1. **Always Review Output**
   - Verify AI-generated code works as intended
   - Test thoroughly before committing
   - Check for security implications
   - Ensure generated code follows project style

2. **Document AI Usage**
   - Comment sections generated by AI
   - Include prompt used if relevant
   - Explain any modifications made to AI output
   - Document review process

3. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Use AI for multiple iterations
   - Ask for explanations of complex parts
   - Have AI suggest improvements
   - Use AI for refactoring suggestions

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Never share sensitive information with AI
   - Review AI-generated code for security issues
   - Use AI to audit security concerns
   - Validate cryptographic implementations

## Contribution Process

1. **Prepare Changes**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Use AI for Development**
   - Generate initial implementation
   - Create tests
   - Write documentation
   - Review changes

3. **Local Testing**
   ```bash
   pio test -e native      # Run unit tests
   pio run                 # Build firmware
   ```

4. **Submit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description of changes"
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use AI to generate PR description
   - Include test results
   - Document AI usage
   - Link related issues

## Example AI Workflow

1. **Feature Planning**
   ```
   Prompt: "Help plan implementation of [feature] including:
   - Required components
   - API design
   - Data structures
   - Error handling strategy"
   ```

2. **Implementation**
   ```
   Prompt: "Generate implementation for [component] based on:
   - These requirements
   - Our coding style
   - Project architecture
   - Including tests"
   ```

3. **Documentation**
   ```
   Prompt: "Create documentation for [component] including:
   - API reference
   - Usage examples
   - Integration guide
   - Troubleshooting"
   ```

4. **Review**
   ```
   Prompt: "Review this implementation for:
   - Code quality
   - Performance
   - Security
   - Test coverage"
   ```

## Commit Messages

Use AI to help generate clear commit messages:

```
Prompt: "Generate a commit message for these changes:
[paste diff or description]
Following conventional commits format"
```

Format:
```
type(scope): description

[body]

[footer]
```

Example:
```
feat(metrics): add network latency monitoring

- Add RTT measurement for WiFi connection
- Implement histogram for latency tracking
- Add metrics endpoint for latency data
- Include documentation and tests

Closes #123
```
